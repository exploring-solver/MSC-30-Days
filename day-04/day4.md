## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! This challenge has been an incredible journey of self-improvement and learning, and I'm excited to share my progress with you.

## Day 4 Progress

Day 4 has been a productive day filled with both coding and exploring new technologies. Here's what I accomplished:

1. **LeetCode Practice:** I dedicated a significant portion of my day to solving LeetCode problems. I successfully solved three problems of easy difficulty. This practice is crucial for honing my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency.

2. **ERP Project:** With the SIH internal hackathon behind me, I shifted my focus to my college's ERP project. I made significant progress in improving the project's functionality and user experience. This project is essential for my academic and practical learning, and I'm committed to making it a success.

3. **Exploring New Technologies:**
   - **React Native:** I started exploring app development using React Native. It's fascinating to see how I can leverage my React skills to build mobile applications for both iOS and Android.
   - **Web3, Ethereum, and Solidity:** I delved into the world of Web3, Ethereum blockchain, and Solidity programming. Understanding the fundamentals of blockchain technology and smart contracts is essential in today's tech landscape, and I'm eager to learn more.

## Reflection

Day 4 has been a well-rounded day of learning and progress. From algorithmic problem-solving to advancing my ERP project and diving into new technologies like React Native and blockchain, I'm continuously expanding my knowledge and skill set.

I look forward to the upcoming days of this challenge, where I'll continue to push my boundaries and work towards becoming a more proficient and versatile developer. The journey is exciting, and the possibilities are endless.
