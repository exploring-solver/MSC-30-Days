# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 3

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! I'm on this journey to challenge myself and track my progress.

## Day 3 Progress

Day 3 was a bit different due to a major event:

1. **Task 1:** I presented my Smart India Hackathon (SIH) project during the internal round. The whole day was dedicated to this presentation, which was a crucial part of the competition. It was a long day, with hours of waiting for a presentation that lasted only 5 minutes.

2. **Task 2:** After returning home, tired from the day's events, I managed to complete 2 LeetCode coding questions. It was a small but valuable effort to continue honing my problem-solving skills.

## Reflection

Day 3 was focused on the SIH internal round presentation, which demanded my attention and energy. Despite the long wait, I remained committed to the competition. I also found a moment to keep up with my LeetCode practice, even though it was a brief session.

As the challenge progresses, I anticipate a balance between project work, learning, and coding practice. I look forward to the upcoming days and the opportunities they bring.
