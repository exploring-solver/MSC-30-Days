# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 19

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! On Day 19, I was actively involved in a hackathon and experienced both the triumph of securing 1st place and the challenges of faulty equipment. Here's a recap of my progress on this eventful day.

## Day 19 Progress

Day 19 was a remarkable day with a major focus on the IIIT Delhi EmpowHer Hackathon. Here's what I achieved:

1. **Hackathon Victory:** My team, named "Team Hoodini," consisting of members @kirinain, @codingpanda252, @ishaanminocha, and myself, secured 1st place in the IIIT Delhi EmpowHer Hackathon. Our project, Sheक्षा, was recognized for its innovative and empowering solution. I'm incredibly proud of our team's achievement.

2. **Challenges:** While the hackathon was a success, it came with its share of challenges. I faced the adversity of working on a faulty laptop screen, and my mobile experienced a CPU short circuit. These unexpected setbacks were not directly related to the challenge but are noteworthy experiences during the event.

3. **Project Repository:** Our hackathon project, Sheक्षा, is available on GitHub. You can explore it at [this link](https://github.com/exploring-solver/IIITD_empowher).

## Reflection

Day 19 was a day of significant achievement and unexpected challenges. Winning 1st place in the hackathon is a testament to the hard work and dedication of Team Hoodini. Our project, Sheक्षा, aims to make a positive impact in women's empowerment, and I'm excited about its potential.

The challenges I faced serve as a reminder of the unpredictability of technology and the importance of adaptability. Despite these hurdles, the day ended on a high note with the success of our hackathon project.

As the Microsoft 30-day challenge continues, I look forward to more opportunities for growth, innovation, and impactful projects. Each day brings its own set of lessons and achievements, and I'm eager to share more in the coming days.
