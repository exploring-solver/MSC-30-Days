# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 2

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! I've embarked on this challenge after hearing about it in a WhatsApp group, and I'm excited to track my progress throughout the journey.

## Day 2 Progress

Day 2 has been another productive day, building upon the momentum from Day 1. Here's what I accomplished:

1. **Task 1:** I dedicated time to solving coding problems on LeetCode. I successfully solved two problems easy difficulty. This practice is helping me refine my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency.

2. **Task 2:** I spent a significant portion of my day, approximately 10-12 hours, working on frontend development using React and Tailwind CSS for my Smart India Hackathon (SIH) project that is a freaking online portal for different users different dashboards almost a mini ERP, Thesis Mate. This project is nearing its presentation date, and I want to ensure it's in the best possible shape.

3. **Task 3:** As part of my ongoing learning, I explored ReactJS chart libraries. This will be valuable for enhancing data visualization in my project and future web development endeavors.

## Reflection

Day 2 has been filled with coding, problem-solving, and project development. The combination of LeetCode practice and frontend work on Thesis Mate is allowing me to grow as a developer. I'm hopeful that the effort I'm putting in now will lead to a better future.

Additionally, staying engaged with these tasks helps me combat loneliness during the night. Keeping myself occupied with meaningful work is proving to be an effective strategy.

I'm eager to see how my progress unfolds in the coming days and how these small contributions add up to significant improvements over the course of this challenge.
