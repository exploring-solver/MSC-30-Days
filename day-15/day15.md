# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 15

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! On Day 15, I continued to strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my knowledge of blockchain technology. Here's a recap of my progress on this day.

## Day 15 Progress

Day 15 was a day of both coding and blockchain learning. Here's what I accomplished:

1. **LeetCode Problem Solving:** I continued to challenge myself by solving two Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems on LeetCode. Problem-solving practice is essential for maintaining and improving coding skills.

2. **Blockchain Course:** In my blockchain course, I focused on important topics, including deployment, error handling, and running a blockchain environment locally and on integrated development environments (IDEs). These skills are critical for deploying and managing smart contracts in a real-world blockchain environment.

## Reflection

Day 15 was marked by a balanced approach to learning and development. Solving LeetCode problems is a valuable practice for staying sharp in coding and problem-solving. It's a skill set that transcends specific technologies and is applicable in various programming contexts.

Additionally, my continued exploration of blockchain technology, including deployment and error handling, prepares me for real-world applications in the blockchain space. Understanding how to run a blockchain environment locally and on IDEs is essential for any blockchain developer.

As the Microsoft 30-day challenge progresses, I remain dedicated to expanding my expertise and embracing new challenges. Each day presents opportunities for growth and learning, and I'm excited to see what lies ahead.

Thank you for following my progress, and stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore and excel in the tech world!
