# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 1

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! I've embarked on this challenge after hearing about it in a WhatsApp group, and I'm excited to track my progress throughout the journey.

## Day 1 Progress

Today marks the beginning of this challenge, and here's what I accomplished:

1. **Task 1:** I wrote several React components for my SIH project, Thesis Mate, focusing on improving the user interface and enhancing the overall user experience.

2. **Task 2:** I spent time solving challenging data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems on LeetCode,, honing my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency.

3. **Task 3:** I participated in a Web3 workshop organised by IEEE MAIT and it gave a lot of insight on blockchain and how web3 market operates and what is the usecase for Web3 in current real world scenerios like gaming, government, currency, bank, Apps,etc.

4. **Task 4:** I learned how to use skyfusion in react components and react-chart-js2 library.

## Reflection

Day 1 has been a productive start to this challenge. I've made significant progress in both my project development and coding skills. By enhancing the UI of Thesis Mate and tackling DSA problems on LeetCode, I'm taking steps toward self-improvement and personal growth. I'm looking forward to the learning opportunities and growth that the next 29 days will bring. 

I hope to stop procrastinating and work on myself to avoid being lonely. By occupying myself with this much tasks, it helps me to overcome lonliness at night :(
