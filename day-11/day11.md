# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 11

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! Day 11 was an incredibly successful and fulfilling day filled with hackathon achievements and project work. Here's a recap of my progress on this remarkable day.

## Day 11 Progress

Day 11 was all about the hackathon, and it was a day of great success. Here's what my team and I accomplished:

1. **Hackathon Success:** We participated in the IIT Delhi hackathon and presented our innovative solutions to improve the productivity of developers and gamers. Our team worked tirelessly to create a Discord bot, a VS Code extension, and a Chrome extension, all aimed at enhancing the tech and gaming experience. We also developed a website to showcase these solutions.

2. **Website Development:** I dedicated my efforts to working on the website to showcase our projects. It's crucial to have a well-designed platform to present our solutions effectively. The website serves as a hub for users to learn about and access our productivity-enhancing tools.

3. **VS Code Extension:** In addition to the website, I also contributed to the development of the VS Code extension. This tool holds the potential to significantly boost the productivity of developers using Visual Studio Code.

## Hackathon Result

I'm thrilled to announce that our hard work and dedication paid off. Out of 250 teams registered in the IIT Delhi hackathon, our team secured 1st place! It's an incredible honor and a testament to the innovative solutions we've created.
