# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 20

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! Day 20 was a balance between maintaining my daily coding practice and contributing to my college's hackathon. Here's a summary of my progress on this day.

## Day 20 Progress

Day 20 was a day of juggling responsibilities, focusing on both personal coding practice and college commitments. Here's what I accomplished:

1. **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):** I dedicated time to solving one DSA problem, ensuring that I consistently hone my problem-solving skills.

2. **Hackathon Preparation - HackWithMAIT:** As a member of the technical team in the TechCom society, I actively contributed to the development of the website for the HackWithMAIT hackathon organized by our college. Collaborating with my team, we made progress in ensuring a seamless and user-friendly website experience for participants.

## Reflection

Day 20 required effective time management and dedication to both personal and college-related responsibilities. Balancing DSA practice with contributing to the development of the HackWithMAIT hackathon website was both challenging and rewarding.

Engaging in both personal and collaborative projects contributes to my overall growth as a developer. The experiences gained from participating in various initiatives enrich my understanding and application of technical skills.

I look forward to the continued progression in both personal and college projects, and I'm excited about the learning opportunities that each new day brings. Stay tuned for more updates as the challenge progresses!
