# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 8

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! This challenge continues to be a fantastic journey of self-improvement and exploration. Here's a recap of my progress on Day 8.

## Day 8 Progress

Day 8 was a day filled with a variety of learning and project-related tasks. Here's what I accomplished:

1. **LeetCode Problem Solving:** I started my day with a coding challenge, solving two Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions on LeetCode. These challenges are instrumental in refining my problem-solving skills.

2. **Hackathon Preparation:** As the IITD HackXtreme hackathon is approaching on October 5th, I spent a considerable amount of time working on our hackathon project. My team and I focused on fine-tuning the project, addressing any issues, and ensuring it's ready for the upcoming event.

3. **Extension Development Learning:** My journey into extension development for both Visual Studio Code and Chrome continued. Exploring this area opens up possibilities for enhancing productivity and customizing development environments.

4. **Discord Bot Development:** I delved into creating a Discord bot. This bot, tailored for gamers and developers, aims to boost productivity and add value to Discord servers. It's an exciting project that combines coding skills with gaming interests.

## Reflection

Day 8 was an enriching day of learning, coding, and project preparation. From DSA problem-solving to hackathon project work and exploring extension development and Discord bot creation, I continue to broaden my horizons in the tech world.

The upcoming IITD HackXtreme event adds a layer of excitement to this challenge, and I'm determined to give it my best. Each day brings new opportunities for growth, and I look forward to sharing more progress in the days ahead. The journey is inspiring, and the learning never stops!
