# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 10

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! This challenge continues to be an exciting journey of self-improvement and exploration. Here's a recap of my progress on Day 10.

## Day 10 Progress

Day 10 was a day focused on project development and learning, as well as a bit of problem-solving. Here's what I accomplished:

1. **Project Development:** I spent a significant part of my day working on the ideal and pre-development prototype for our project with my team, WrenchD. We are preparing to participate in the HackXtreme hackathon, and our project, "ProDuckTVT," aims to bring innovation to the tech world. You can find our project repository at [https://github.com/IshaanMinocha/ProDuckTVT](https://github.com/IshaanMinocha/ProDuckTVT).

2. **VS Code Extension Learning:** To enhance our project and create a VS Code extension, I delved into learning the technologies required for it. Developing a VS Code extension can offer significant productivity improvements for developers, and I'm excited about this aspect of our project. 

3. **LeetCode Problem Solving:** Keeping my problem-solving skills sharp, I solved one challenging Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) question on LeetCode. These exercises continue to help me refine my coding skills.

## Reflection

Day 10 was a productive day of project development, learning, and problem-solving. Preparing for the HackXtreme hackathon with my team is an exciting endeavor, and I'm looking forward to the innovation we'll bring to the table.

Learning the technologies required for creating a VS Code extension is an essential step in enhancing our project's capabilities. It's a valuable skill that can benefit both our project and future endeavors.

As the challenge progresses, I'm continuously expanding my knowledge and skills, and I'm eager to see how our project evolves. Stay tuned for more updates on my journey of self-improvement and exploration!
