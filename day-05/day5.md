# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 5

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! This challenge has been an incredible journey of self-improvement and learning, and I'm excited to share my progress with you.

## Day 5 Progress

Day 5 was another productive day filled with coding and working on meaningful projects. Here's what I accomplished:

1. **ERP Project for College:** I dedicated a significant portion of my day to improving my college's ERP project.

2. **Personal Project - EduMania:** I started a new personal project called "EduMania." It's a competitive exams-oriented game that combines learning and fun. I worked on the initial project setup, design and began laying out the game's mechanics for the quiz. This project reflects my passion for education and technology.

3. **LeetCode Problem Solving:** I continued my daily practice of solving LeetCode problems. Today, I tackled three Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions.

## Reflection

Day 5 has been a day of learning and project development. From advancing my college's ERP system to embarking on a new journey with the EduMania project and consistently practicing DSA on LeetCode, 

As I move forward in this challenge, I remain excited about the opportunities for growth and innovation. Each day brings new challenges and learning experiences, and I'm committed to making the most of this journey. The path ahead is promising, and I look forward to sharing more progress in the coming days.
