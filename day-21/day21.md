# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 21

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! Day 21 was a day of recovery and resuming my daily coding practice. Here's a brief update on my progress for the day.

## Day 21 Progress

Day 21 was a day focused on regaining energy and consistency in my challenge. Here's what I achieved:

1. **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):** After taking some time for recovery, I got back on track with my daily coding practice by solving one DSA problem. It's important to maintain the habit of problem-solving to keep my skills sharp.

2. **Recovery:** This day allowed me to rest and recover, ensuring that I'm in the best condition to continue the challenge.

## Reflection

Day 21 was a day of taking a step back to recover and recharge. Consistency is essential in any challenge, but it's equally important to recognize when rest is needed. The brief break allowed me to return with renewed energy and focus.

As the challenge progresses, I look forward to more opportunities for growth and learning. Each day brings its own set of lessons, and I'm eager to continue sharing my journey with you.
