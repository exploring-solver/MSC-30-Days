# Microsoft 30-Day Challenge - Day 9

## Introduction

Welcome to my Microsoft 30-day challenge progress report! This challenge continues to be a fantastic journey of self-improvement and exploration. Here's a recap of my progress on Day 9.

Sorry for updating my progress so late as past 4 days after the day 8 were very busy and full of work so i wasn't able to update the repository.
## Day 9 Progress

Day 9 was a day focused on blockchain technology and problem-solving. Here's what I accomplished:

1. **Blockchain Skill Development:** I dedicated a significant portion of my day to deepening my understanding of blockchain technology. I explored the fundamentals of blockchain, learned about Ethereum, and delved into using the Metamask wallet. Understanding blockchain is becoming increasingly crucial in today's tech landscape.

2. **LeetCode Problem Solving:** To maintain my problem-solving skills, I tackled two challenging Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions on LeetCode. These exercises help me sharpen my problem-solving abilities and coding skills.

## Reflection

Day 9 was a day of immersion in blockchain technology and continued commitment to problem-solving. The world of blockchain holds immense potential, and gaining proficiency in this field is exciting.

Solving LeetCode questions alongside blockchain learning keeps me well-rounded in my technical abilities. Each day of this challenge brings new opportunities for growth, and I'm eager to continue this journey of self-improvement.

Stay tuned for more updates on my progress as I move forward in this 30-day challenge. The learning never stops, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me!
